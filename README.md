# Wolkenkijker building instructions
Hello! Welcome to the Wolkenkijker instruction page. This repository contains all the files you need to build your own Wolkenkijker, or modify it to your liking. The instructions below assume you want to build a perfect copy. However, I included the Fusion360 file where the object was built, so you can modify it to your liking.

## Bill of materials
- Picture frame glass (min. 100 x 100 mm, thickness 1 mm)
- Grinding dust
- Biconvex lens (focal length 95.5 mm diameter 50 mm)
- [Fresnel lens](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005008116547795.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.31.54b81802VggjWI&gatewayAdapt=glo2nld) (focal length 120 mm, dimensions 100 x 100 mm)
- [Front surface mirror](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005004853298387.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.16.54b81802VggjWI&gatewayAdapt=glo2nld) 123 x 100 mm, thickness 1.1 mm. [This supplier](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/1100386575?spm=a2g0o.detail.0.0.79d4c7iEc7iE3z) makes custom sized mirrors.
- Push rivets
- Glass cutter

## Manufacture the aluminium parts
[STEP file for the 1mm aluminium parts](Manufacturing/Sheet%20metal%201mm.step)
I had the aluminium parts produced by a manufacturer who laser cut, bent and anodized them. The [JLCCNC](https://jlccnc.com/sheet-metal-quote) seems to be quite fast and cheap.
I had them produced from 1 mm thick 5052 aluminum, anodized black. 

## Print the 3D prints
[Folder containing the 3D print files](Manufacturing/3D%20Print/)
The parts, specifically the lens assembly, looks best printed in resin. I had them printed by [JLC3DP](https://jlc3dp.com/).

## Grind the ground glass
1. Cut the glass to size (100 x 90 mm)
2. Grind the glass according to the instructions in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVCxuESAiCw)

## Assemble your Wolkenkijker
1. Adhere the mirror to the bottom aluminium plate using your favorite adhesive.
2. [See this document for assembly instructions](Assembly%20manual/Wolkenkijker%20assembly%20instruction.pdf)

## Possible alternative materials
- The aluminium parts can be replaced by any other sheet material. The files are based on 1mm thickness. In the past, I successfully prototyped from cardboard.
- The ground glass can be replaced by pre-ground glass. In the prototyping phase, I used some baking sheets as a temporary placeholder instead of the glass.
