# Wolkenkijker building instructions
Hello! Welcome to the Wolkenkijker instruction page. This repository contains all the files you need to build your own Wolkenkijker, or modify it to your liking. The instructions below assume you want to build a perfect copy. However, I included the Fusion360 file where the object was built, so you can modify it to your liking.

## Possible alternative materials
- The aluminium parts can be replaced by any other sheet material. The files are based on 1mm thickness. In the past, I successfully prototyped from cardboard.
- The ground glass can be replaced by pre-ground glass. In the prototyping phase, I used some baking sheets as a temporary placeholder instead of the glass.
